## Description

This all-encompassing platform is aimed at providing students with the most important collegiate and personal data they need to succeed at UCLA and beyond. The site layout is available in the UXFiles folder and are broken down into two different visualizations: wireframe and page layout. In addition, User Flow Chart has been uploaded illuminating how each user may approach the webpage. A data specific flowchart is in the process of being developed and uploaded, which will show how and what kind of data users will input to interact with the web application. Overall, these files illuminate the interactability of the website and how our services enable students to reach their highest potential through calculated organization, data handling, and planning.

## Motivation

Bricks & Trees is focused on streamlining the process of being an undergraduate student. In a world full of data, often times it is difficult to locate what resources are out there and how to go about taking advantage of them. We are particularly focused on developing code that can help students better organize their academic, social, and professoinal spheres of life so that they have one less thing to worry about. We do this by creating, maintaining, and trademarking unique features that have applicability in every university setting.
